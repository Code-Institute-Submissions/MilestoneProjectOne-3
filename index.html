                                <p> Engaging in regular exercise is the best way to keep fit and healthy. 
                                    Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss.
                                    Keeping active is also a great way to keep your mind sharp.

                                <p> Exercising frequently will improve your cardiovascular health. 
                                    Your heart is a muscle, just like any other muscle in your body, and should be worked out.  
                                    You can get the blood pumping when you work out, especially when running, jumping & lifting. </p>

                            His class was great fun, motivational and effective. 
                            His wonderful playlists got us moving, old ladies forgot their aches and pains as they exercised to his great music. 
                            He cheered everyone up, always had a smile, and his energy and dance moves were a joy to watch."

                            He had a very kind and gentle approach to teaching, he acknowledged my fear in the water and personalised technigues that helped me relax in the water and become confident in my abilities. 
                            Thanks to Iain I am now confident in the water and absolutely love swimming. 
                            Iain devised a personal program for the areas I wanted to concentrate on improving.  
                            My confidence and ability has definitely grown to a point where I now really enjoy my time in the gym.
                            I highly recommend Iain as a fitness/swim instructor for somebody wanting to reach their individual goals and fitness levels."

                            The product he delivers to me has responded to any challenge and consistently improved in quality over time.
                            Iain's classes are an excellent fit for me as they are varied and fun. 
                            Iain is very professional and is always there early with class equipment set up ready to greet participants as they arrive. 
                            He also has good session plans made but is comfortable to adapt if an extra person turns up or if somebody joins in late."
